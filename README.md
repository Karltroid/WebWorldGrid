# WebWorldGrid
This is a little test project I did to see how well HTML elements could perform if used to make a grid based world. In this web app you use the scroll wheel to zoom in/out, and click + drag to move around the world. As you expose new areas of the map more of the world is dynamically generated.

Warning, this is a fun test WILL LAG THE MORE ELEMENTS/GRIDS ARE ON SCREEN
